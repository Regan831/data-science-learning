"""I just read about entropy. Entropy shows how useful a certain attribute is for classification. Entropy is the average amount of information contained in each item received. The less likely an event occurs the more information it provides. Entropy's formula is simply, -p1(log(p1)) - p2(log(p2)) - ... where the log is base 2. Max entropy is found when the data is most impure, or when there are equal number of different outputs.
Ex. Looking to see if an item is a + or -, entropy is max when there are equal +'s and -'s. On the flip side, entropy is minimized when the data contains only one result, all +'s.

The data set I am using to test entropy was found at:

#Next task will be to identify the parent entropy. Aka the entropy for the entire data set. This is straightforward since I made the function to calculate entropy if you have positive and negative counts. In this case we will say that positive is edible. that's a better situation than eating a poisonous mushroom.

"""That number is pretty damn close to 1 meaning the entropy is high in this data set. This is expected because the mushrooms are almost split 50/50 between poisonous and edible.

Now that I have the parent entropy I can calculate the information gained from each attribute in the data set. The formula for this is also quite simple:

IG(parent,attribute) = entropy(parent) - (p(a1)*entropy(a1) + p(a2)*entropy(a2) + ...) 

A high IG is good. A high IG means that using this attribute to seperate the data lowers the entropy in each cohort. If you look at the formula, it takes the parent entropy and subtracts the weighted entropy of each cohort. Meaning if the cohort entropy is small, there will not be much to take away from the parent entropy.

Before I go into the next part I am going to remove spaces from the column headers.
