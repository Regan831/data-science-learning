# data-science-learning
Learning the foundations of data science. And learning more Python along the way.

I recently started to learn more about data science and all that goes with it. I am using Kaggle and "Data Science 
for Business" by Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett. Basically I will be putting my code here for a chapter in the book 
or for a competition I enter on Kaggle.
